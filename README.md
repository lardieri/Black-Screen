# Black Screen

A simple app to display nothing but a black screen.

## Why?

If you need to leave your iOS device plugged in and turned on for an extended period of time, but don’t want to damage your beautiful OLED display with **“Burn In”**, then you can run this app in the foreground.

## Example Scenarios

- Using your device as a music player.

- Extended file sync operation, e.g. downloading many gigabytes from OneDrive.

- Using your iPad Pro in Stage Manager mode with an external monitor, keyboard, and mouse.
